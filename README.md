# Secret Sharing with Lagrange Interpolation -  Catalog Placements Assignment

This project implements a secret sharing scheme using Lagrange interpolation. The `SecretSharing` class processes test cases provided in JSON format from files. The main functionality includes validating input data, decoding values, and reconstructing secrets based on provided x and y values.

## Expected Output

The output will display the computed secrets for each test case fetched from the files. Below is an example of the output generated by the program:

The output shows the secrets computed for each test case, demonstrating the successful execution of the Lagrange interpolation algorithm.




## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to implement a secret sharing scheme using Lagrange interpolation in JavaScript, allowing for dynamic data fetching and processing.
